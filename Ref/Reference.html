        <h2>Ancestral Puebloans</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Long before modern Gallup took shape, the region was home to the Ancestral Puebloans, who lived here from roughly 300 BCE to 1250 CE. They cultivated corn, beans, and squash, crafted artisanal goods, and built intricate structures that served as both homes and gathering spaces. Their legacy endures across the region’s national monuments, tribal parks, and archaeological sites.</p>
