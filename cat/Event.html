        <p>
          Maitso began with a passion for exploring and a respect for global traditions.
          I grew up with a curiosity about different cultures, finding my discipline and
          purpose when I joined the army, where I learned the value of teamwork, resilience,
          and attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing my military service, I started on a journey that took me across
          continents. Visiting countries from Thailand to Italy, I immersed myself in local
          cultures, learning cooking techniques that were handed down through generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These experiences showed me the universal language of food and of its ability to
          bring people together across cultural boundaries. I came home with a vision to create
          a restaurant that honored these traditions while re-imagining them in a sustainable,
          plant-focused setting. That's how Maitso was born.
